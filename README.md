# GCTU Attendance Recording System
Welcome to the Ghana Communication Technology University (GCTU) Attendance Recording System—a solution designed to transform how attendance is tracked at the university. For years, GCTU, like many other institutions, faced the challenges of managing attendance manually. Faculty and staff relied on paper-based attendance sheets, which often led to lost records, delays, and frustrating discrepancies. These errors made it difficult to track student attendance in real time, creating more work for everyone involved.

The GCTU Attendance Recording System was developed to solve these issues by automating the entire process. Now, attendance is recorded and updated in real-time, directly on the platform. Gone are the days of waiting for updates or fearing discrepancies—everything is always up-to-date, and both students and faculty can stay informed. By simplifying the process, this system saves time and ensures accuracy, making administrative tasks more efficient and less prone to error.

Built with the latest technologies, the system uses React.js for a dynamic, interactive interface that updates instantly as attendance is recorded. This ensures a seamless and responsive experience for users, whether on a computer, tablet, or smartphone. The backend, powered by Node.js, processes all requests and manages the flow of data, ensuring everything runs smoothly even when handling large volumes of users. Attendance records are securely stored and easily accessible in the system’s SQL database, which allows for fast retrieval and reliable updates as new data is entered.

Together, these technologies work in harmony to provide a real-time, scalable solution to attendance management. With the GCTU Attendance Recording System, both students and faculty benefit from a more reliable, efficient, and user-friendly system that keeps everything running smoothly and ensures that attendance data is always accurate and up-to-date.
